The world map is a graphical representation of the Earth's surface. It shows continents, countries, oceans, and other geographical features.

There are seven continents on Earth: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. Asia is the largest continent, covering about 30% of the Earth's land area.

Oceans cover approximately 71% of the Earth's surface. The five major oceans are the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest of all.

Maps are often drawn using various projections to represent the curved surface of the Earth on flat paper. The Mercator projection is commonly used for navigation but distorts the size of land masses near the poles.

Countries are political divisions shown on the world map. As of 2024, there are 195 countries recognized globally, with the United Nations having 193 member states.

Longitude and latitude are imaginary lines used to locate positions on the Earth's surface. The Equator divides the Earth into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, while the Prime Meridian divides it into Eastern and Western Hemispheres.

The largest country by land area is Russia, and the smallest is Vatican City. The most populous country is China, followed closely by India.

Maps are essential tools for education, navigation, research, and understanding global geography.
